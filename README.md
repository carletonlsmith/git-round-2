# Capstone Title

# Introduction
In this section, I would explain the purpose of my project and the relevant context. You could also list who the end user of your model or analysis would be and how they would benefit from it. Basically, state the analysis question.

# Methodology
This is where you would describe how you went about your analysis. Name the assumptions you made and methods you used and why.

# Results
Here where you present the results of your analysis. Maybe you have tables and charts in this section.

# Conclusion
In the conclusion, state your recommendation and your main findings. Make sure you can describe where your model falls short or what this analysis does and does not mean.

# Future Work
With more time and more data, I would do X, Y, and Z to further this analysis.
